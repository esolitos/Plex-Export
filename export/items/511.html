							<div class="plex-item-summary"><p>Tron: Legacy is a 2010 American science fiction film released by Walt Disney Pictures. A sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Tron, it is directed by Joseph Kosinski, produced by Tron director Steven Lisberger, and written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, based on a story by Horowitz, Kitsis, Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal. The cast includes Tron veterans Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner, who reprised their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley, as well as actors and actresses such as Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, Beau Garrett, Michael Sheen, and James Frain. The story follows Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund), who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called the Grid, where Sam, his father, and the algorithm Quorra (Olivia Wilde) stop the malevolent program CLU from invading the human world.

Interests in creating a sequel for Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, a concerted effort to devise Tron: Legacy began in 2005, when producers hired Klugman and Sternthal as writers for the film. Kosinski was recruited for the directing role two years later. Since he was not optimistic about Walt Disney Studios' Matrix-esque approach to the film, he opted for a loan, which he used to cultivate a prototype and conceptualize the universe of Tron: Legacy. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Tron: Legacy was wholly shot in 3D, and 10 companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. 

Disney aggressively promoted Tron: Legacy, which was received with mixed reviews by film critics, who generally praised the special effects and soundtrack but were critical of the character development and the performance of the cast. The film grossed over $400 million during its worldwide theatrical run.</p></div>
