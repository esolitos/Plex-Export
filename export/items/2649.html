							<div class="plex-item-summary"><p>Jab Tak Hai Jaan, also known as JTHJ, is a 2012 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra and written and produced by Aditya Chopra under their production banner Yash Raj Films. The film features Shahrukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma in lead roles, making it the first film to pair Khan and Kaif and the second collaboration between Khan and Sharma after Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. It was Yash Chopra's fourth film to feature Shahrukh Khan in the lead role, the former returning as a director after eight years post Veer-Zaara, which released in 2004. Jab Tak Hai Jaan was Yash Chopra's last directorial venture before his death on 21 October 2012.

The background score and soundtrack were composed by A.R. Rahman, while the lyrics penned by Gulzar. The film released during the six-day Diwali weekend that began on 13 November 2012. 

Jab Tak Hai Jaan received positive to mixed reviews from critics in India and positive reviews from critics overseas. It also opened well at the box office. Some sources have opined that the film might have drawn inspiration from the Graham Greene novel The End of the Affair. Box Office India declared the film a "hit" in India and a "blockbuster" overseas. Jab Tak Hai Jaan is the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time overseas after My Name Is Khan and 3 Idiots.

Jab Tak Hai Jaan has been widely appreciated for its direction, cinematography and the chemistry between the lead actors with Shahrukh Khan and Anushka Sharma receiving accolades for their performances, though criticism has been generated regarding its script and plot predictability. The film received several awards at popular award ceremonies including four Filmfare trophies.</p></div>
