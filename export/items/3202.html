							<div class="plex-item-summary"><p>Gravity is a 2013 British-American 3D science-fiction thriller and space drama film. Directed, co-written, co-produced and co-edited by Alfonso Cuarón, the film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts involved in the mid-orbit destruction of a space shuttle and their attempt to return to Earth.

Cuarón wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás and attempted to develop the project at Universal Studios. After the rights to the project were sold, the project found traction at Warner Bros. instead. The studio approached multiple actresses before casting Bullock in the female lead role. Robert Downey Jr. was also involved as the male lead before leaving the project and being replaced by Clooney. David Heyman, who previously worked with Cuarón on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, produced the film with him. London-based VFX company Framestore spent over 3 years creating most of the visual effects for the entire movie encompassing over 80 minutes of screen time.

Gravity opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August 2013. Its North American premiere was three days later at the Telluride Film Festival. It received a wide release in the United States and Canada on October 4, 2013. The film was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike; both groups giving praise for Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, Steven Price's musical score, Cuarón's direction, Bullock's performance and the advancements in visual effects under Tim Webber's supervision. In 2014, the film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Alfonso Cuarón) and Best Actress (Sandra Bullock). The film also scored big at the 2014 Critics Choice Awards winning seven awards.</p></div>
