							<div class="plex-item-summary"><p>Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is a 2013 American fantasy-adventure film based on the Rick Riordan novel of the same name. It is a stand-alone sequel to the 2010 film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief and is the second installment in the Percy Jackson film series. It continues the adventures of Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) and his friends, as they search for the Golden Fleece at the eponymous Sea of Monsters (better known to the humans as the Bermuda Triangle) in order to save an ailing magical tree that protects their home from foes. In the film, Percy is filled with self-doubt as just a "one-quest wonder".

The film was produced by Karen Rosenfelt, Mark Radcliffe and Chris Columbus (who served as the director for the first film) under Fox 2000 and directed byÂ Thor Freudenthal. Originally planned for a March 2013 release, the film was pushed to August 16 but was eventually released on August 7 of the same year. and was converted to 3D in post-production. The film was released to mixed reviews from critics with praise for the performances of the young leads as well as Nathan Fillion's performance as Hermes, but criticisms for its plot and characterization. The film, expanded to over just 30 territories outside of North America. The film has been commercially successful and as of November 19 has raked in $200 million at the worldwide box office against a budget of $90 million.

It stars Lerman as the titular hero with Brandon T. Jackson, Alexandra Daddario, and Jake Abel reprising their roles from the previous film. Also Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head replace Dylan Neal and Pierce Brosnan as Hermes and Chiron respectively from the previous film. New additions to the cast include Leven Rambin as Clarisse La Rue, Douglas Smith as Percy's cyclops half-brother Tyson, Stanley Tucci as Dionysus, the director of Camp Half-Blood. Filming began in late April 2012 and concluded in July of the same year with reshoots taking place in January 2013. It was shot in Vancouver and New Orleans.</p></div>
