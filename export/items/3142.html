							<div class="plex-item-summary"><p>The Whistleblower is a 2010 thriller film directed by Larysa Kondracki, written by Kondracki and Eilis Kirwan, and starring Rachel Weisz. The film was inspired by the account of Kathryn Bolkovac, a Nebraska police officer who was recruited to serve as a UN peacekeeper with DynCorp International in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1999. While there, she discovered a sex trafficking ring that serviced and was facilitated by various DynCorp employees. Bolkovac was fired and forced out of the country after attempting to report and shut down the ring. She subsequently took the story to the BBC News in England and won a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against DynCorp.

Kondracki wanted her debut film to be about human trafficking and came across Bolkovac's story while in college. The process of producing the film took several years, but filming eventually took place from October to December in 2009. Advertised as a fictional dramatization of the events of the late 1990s, Kondracki states that the broad facts are accurate but that some of the details were omitted during the production. For example, she chose not to show the three-week "breaking in" period the trafficking victims are subjected to.

The Whistleblower premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival[http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/article/the-complete-2010-toronto-international-film-festival-line-up "The Complete 2010 Toronto International Film Festival Line-up"]. Rope of Silicon (August 24, 2010). Retrieved May 27, 2011. and was distributed theatrically in the United States by Samuel Goldwyn Films in August 2011. The movie drew mixed responses; a number of the actors and actresses received praise for their performances, but the intense violence depicted in several of the scenes became a subject of debate among reviewers, with some criticizing it as exploitive. Kondracki and Weisz responded that what had happened in Bosnia had actually been toned down in the film portrayal. The Whistleblower received several awards and nominations, including for the 2012 Genie Awards.</p></div>
