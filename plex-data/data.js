Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the jury's final instructions before retiring, a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, and two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie.\n\n12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. Apart from two of the jurors swapping names while leaving the courthouse, no names are used in the film: the defendant is referred to as \"the boy\" and the witnesses as the \"old man\" and \"the lady across the street\".\n\nIn 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".","studio":"Orion-Nova Productions","genre":["Drama"],"director":["William Friedkin","Sidney Lumet"],"role":["Jack Klugman","E.

He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before his release. The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited in 1968 by Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, carefully retraced and validated the account and concluded it to be accurate.\n\nThis is the third feature film directed by Steve McQueen written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor starred in the leading role of Northup. Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt and Alfre Woodard featured in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012, on a production budget of $20 million. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Magnolia, Bocage, and Destrehan. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.\n\n12 Years a Slave received critical acclaim following its release in 2013, and was named the best film of the year by several media outlets. In 2014, the film was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, and received nine Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for McQueen, Best Actor for Ejiofor, Best Supporting Actor for Fassbender, and Best Supporting Actress for Nyong'o. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) recognised the film with its Best Film award in February 2014, with Ejiofor winning the BAFTA for Best Actor.","studio":"Regency Enterprises","genre":["Drama","Historical drama","Biographical film"],"director":["Steve McQueen"],"role":["Jarett Shorts","John C.

(titled Flying High! in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan, and the Philippines) is a 1980 American satirical comedy film directed and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker and released by Paramount Pictures. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson. The film is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, which it follows fairly closely, with superficial changes. For example, Ted Striker was Ted Stryker in the older film. The film is known for its use of absurd and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.\n\nAirplane! was a financial success, grossing over US$83 million in North America alone, against a budget of just $3.5 million. The film's creators received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy, and nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.\n\nIn the years since its release, Airplane!s reputation has grown substantially. The film was voted the 10th-funniest American comedy on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list in 2000, and ranked sixth on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies. In a major 2007 survey by Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, it was judged the second greatest comedy film of all time.\n\nIn 2008, Airplane! was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time and in 2012 was voted No. 1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. In 2010 it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nSeveral of the spoken lines, or gags, have become enduring puns in American culture.","studio":"Paramount Pictures","genre":["Disaster","Absurdism","Cult","Airplanes and airports","Comedy","Romance Film","Satire","Parody","Ensemble Film"],"director":["David Zucker","Jim Abrahams","Jerry Zucker"],"role":["Ethel Merman","Stephen Stucker","Howard Jarvis","Barbara Billingsley","Frank Ashmore","David Leisure","Michelle stacy","Ross Harris","Jill Whelan","Jimmie Walker","Al White","Robert Hays","Julie Hagerty","Leslie Nielsen","Robert Stack","Lloyd Bridges","Peter Graves","Kareem Abdul-Jabbar","Lorna Patterson"],"media":{"bitrate":3009,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":720,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1979060148}},"18":{"key":18,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_18.jpeg","title":"Aladdin","duration":5202760,"view_count":0,"tagline":"Wish granted!","rating":8.3999996185303,"user_rating":false,"release_year":1992,"release_date":"1992-11-11","addedAt":1355995208,"content_rating":"G","summary":"Aladdin is a 1992 American animated musical family film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice, who took over after the former's death.\n\nAladdin was released on November 25, 1992 to positive reviews and was the most successful film of 1992, earning over $217 million in revenue in the United States, and over $504 million worldwide.

David Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, Milo\u0161 Forman and Cameron Crowe had all been possible candidates for director before Spielberg decided to direct. Filming took place from February to May 2002. The film was a financial and critical success, and the real Abagnale reacted positively to it.","studio":"Amblin Entertainment","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama","Crime Fiction"],"director":["Steven Spielberg"],"role":["Ellen Pompeo","Amy Adams","Nathalie Baye","Jennifer Garner","Kaitlin Doubleday","James Brolin","Candice Azzara","Steve Eastin","Elizabeth Banks","Frank John Hughes","Nancy Lenehan","Amy Acker","Brian Howe","John Finn","Chris Ellis","James Morrison","Nick Zano","Leonardo DiCaprio","Tom Hanks","Christopher Walken","Martin Sheen"],"media":{"bitrate":1480,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"audio_codec":"mp3","video_codec":"mpeg4","video_resolution":0,"video_framerate":"PAL","total_size":1467676672}},"84":{"key":84,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_84.jpeg","title":"Cave of Forgotten Dreams","duration":5407445,"view_count":0,"tagline":false,"rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2010,"release_date":"2010-09-10","addedAt":1355995218,"content_rating":"G","summary":"Werner Herzog gains exclusive access to film inside the Chauvet caves of Southern France, capturing the oldest known pictorial creations of humankind in their astonishing natural setting.","studio":"Creative Differences Productions","genre":["History","World cinema","Documentary"],"director":["Werner Herzog"],"role":["Werner Herzog","Dominique Baffier","Jean Clottes","Jean-Michel Geneste"],"media":{"bitrate":2382,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"audio_codec":"aac","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":1080,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1610033071}},"85":{"key":85,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_85.jpeg","title":"Changeling","duration":8514416,"view_count":0,"tagline":"To find her son, she did what no one else dared.","rating":8.3000001907349,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2008,"release_date":"2008-05-20","addedAt":1355995218,"content_rating":"R","summary":"Christine Collins is overjoyed when her kidnapped son is brought back home.

S. Lewis's epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. It is the second in The Chronicles of Narnia film series from Walden Media, following The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). The four Pevensie children (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley) return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) in his struggle for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). The film was released on May 16, 2008 in the United States and on June 26, 2008 in the United Kingdom. The screenplay based on the novel by C. S. Lewis was written by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus.\n\nPrince Caspian is also the last Narnia film to be distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, as 20th Century Fox became the distributor of its future films starting with The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Work on the script began before The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released, so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts. Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first, and created an action sequence not in the novel. The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution, stressing the darker tone of the sequel. The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines. Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand, but unlike the previous film, the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe, because of the larger sets available in those countries. To keep costs down, Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK, because of recent tax credits there.\n\nThe film was a moderate success in the United States and Canada with a total sum of $141 million. and $278 million in the rest of the world. It received mixed to positive reviews from film critics. Some criticism was based on Prince Caspians plot and imagery being substantially darker than that of the previous film, and on the great amount of violence portrayed in the film, whilst others praised its acting, visuals, and story. It went on to become 2008's 10th highest grossing film worldwide.","studio":"Walden Media","genre":["Children's\/Family","Fantasy","Adventure film","Fantasy Adventure","Christian film","Family","Action\/Adventure"],"director":["Andrew Adamson"],"role":["Karolina Matouskova","Ben Barnes","Marcus O'Donovan","Jack Walley","Shane Rangi","Kristina Madericova","John Bach","Eddie Izzard","Lucie Solarova","Douglas Gresham","Peter Dinklage","Gomez Sandoval","Kl\u00e1ra Issov\u00e1","Juan Diego Montoya Garcia","Michaela Dvorska","Adam Valdez","David Mottl","Pierfrancesco Favino","Harry Gregson-Williams","Tim Hands","Alicia Borrachero","Rob Derry","Ashley Jones","Sergio Castellitto","Tilda Swinton","Cornell S.

This is the first film in the series not to be distributed by The Walt Disney Company, as 20th Century Fox became the distributor of the future films, and the only film in the series to be released in Digital 3D.\n\nThe film is set three Narnian years after the events of Prince Caspian. The two youngest Pevensie siblings, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley), are transported back to Narnia along with their cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter). They join the new king of Narnia, Caspian (Ben Barnes), in his quest to rescue seven lost lords and to save Narnia from a corrupting evil that resides on a dark island. Each character is tested as they journey to the home of the great lion Aslan at the far end of the world.\n\nDevelopment on The Voyage of the Dawn Treader began in 2007, while Prince Caspian was still in production. Filming was supposed to take place in Malta, Czech Republic and Iceland in 2008 with Michael Apted as its new director, for a planned release in 2009. But production was halted after a budgetary dispute between Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures concerning Prince Caspians performance at the box office, resulting in Disney departing the production and being replaced by 20th Century Fox. Filming later took place in Australia and New Zealand in 2009 and was converted into 3D in 2010. It was released in traditional 2D, RealD 3D, and Digital 3D, and a limited release in 4D. The screenplay based on the novel by C. S. Lewis was written by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus.\n\nThe film premiered on November 30, 2010, at a Royal Film Performance in London and was released worldwide on December 10, 2010 and was commercially successful but met with mixed reviews praising the performances and visual effects but criticizing the script and pace. The film received moderate success in North America with a gross of $104 million, which was lower than its predecessors. However, it fared better than Prince Caspian internationally with $310 million. The film was the 12th highest-grossing film of 2010 worldwide with nearly $415 million and received a nomination at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.

The film starred Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowall, and Martin Landau. The music score was by Alex North. It was photographed in 70 mm Todd-AO by Leon Shamroy and an uncredited Jack Hildyard.\n\nCleopatra chronicles the struggles of Cleopatra VII, the young Queen of Egypt, to resist the imperialist ambitions of Rome.\n\nIn all of cinema history, Cleopatra is one of the most expensive films ever made (adjusted for inflation). It received mixed reviews from critics, although critics and audiences alike generally praised Taylor and Burton's performances. It was the highest grossing film of 1963, earning US $26 million ($57.7 million total), yet made a loss due to its cost of $44 million, making it the only film ever to be the highest grossing film of the year yet to run at a loss; for this, the film has been considered a moderate (but not total) box office failure. The film later won four Academy Awards, and was nominated for five more, including Best Picture (ultimately losing to Tom Jones).","studio":"20th Century Fox","genre":["Romance Film","Biographical film","History","Costume drama","Period piece","Roadshow theatrical release","Romantic drama","Epic","Drama","War film"],"director":["Darryl F.

Other supporting roles are played by Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, and child actor Jack Nation.

The novel on which the film was based, was actually inspired by country singer Hank Thompson. Bridges earned the 2009 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.\n\nFilming took place during 2008 in New Mexico (Albuquerque, Espa\u00f1ola, Galisteo, Santa Fe), in Houston, Texas, and in Los Angeles, California. Original music for the film was composed by T-Bone Burnett, Stephen Bruton, Ryan Bingham and others. Bingham and Burnett received the 2009 Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing \"The Weary Kind\", which Bingham also performed.\n\nThe film was produced for $7 million by Country Music Television, and was originally acquired by Paramount Vantage for a direct-to-video release, but was later purchased for theatrical distribution by Fox Searchlight Pictures.

Hitchcock's film adds a second setting in a gentleman's club, a few views of the street outside, and a stylized courtroom montage. Having seen the play on Broadway, Cary Grant was keen to play the role of Tony Wendice, but studio chiefs did not feel the public would accept him as a man who arranges to have his wife murdered.\n\nIn June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\" list - the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres - after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community.

It is based on the British comic 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopian metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his inexperienced sidekick, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of flats and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).\n\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, that would be unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg, began in November 2010.\n\nDredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September 2012 worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic and on excessive violence.

Written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City.\n\nThe film is both an homage to, and a self-parody of, conventional Walt Disney Animated Classics, making numerous references to Disney's past and future works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation and computer-generated imagery. It heralds the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, produced the songs of Enchanted, with Menken also composing its score.\n\nThe animation sequences were produced at James Baxter Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the London Film Festival before its wide release on November 21, 2007, in the United States. Enchanted was well-received critically. It won the 2007 Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Motion Picture, received two nominations at the 65th Golden Globe Awards and three nominations at the 80th Academy Awards.

He was also one of the film's writers.\n\nIn 2004, Enter the Dragon was deemed \"culturally significant\" in the United States and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nEnter the Dragon was the first Chinese martial arts film to have been produced by a major Hollywood studio \u2013 Warner Bros. and was produced in association with Golden Harvest and Lee's Concord Production Company. The film is largely set in Hong Kong.\n\nAmong the stuntmen for the film were members of the Seven Little Fortunes, including Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Bolo Yeung. This was arguably instrumental in Chan and Hung's further association with Golden Harvest studios, which later launched their careers. The portly Hung is shown fighting Lee in the opening sequence of the movie and Chan shows up as a henchman when Lee is discovered inside Han's underground lair.\n\nThe finished version of the film was not significantly different from the original screenplay. Bruce Lee did not revise the script. Bruce Lee directed the film's opening Shaolin Monastery fight sequence. Lee wanted to use the film as a vehicle for expressing what he saw as the beauty of his Chinese culture, rather than it being just another action film.

It is an adaptation of the 1964 Broadway musical of the same name, with music composed by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and screenplay by Joseph Stein. The film won three Academy Awards, including one for arranger-conductor John Williams. It was nominated for several more, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Topol as Tevye, and Best Supporting Actor for Leonard Frey, who played Motel Kamzoil the Tailor (both had originally acted in the musical; Topol as Tevye in the London production and Frey in a minor part as Mendel, the rabbi's son). The decision to cast Topol, instead of Zero Mostel, as Tevye was a somewhat controversial one, as the role had originated with Mostel and he had made it famous. Years later, Jewison explained that he felt Mostel's larger-than-life personality, while fine on stage, would cause movie audiences to see him (i.e., Zero Mostel the actor) rather than the character of Tevye.\n\nPrincipal photography was done at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Most of the exterior shots were done in SFR Yugoslavia - specifically in Mala Gorica, Lekenik, and Zagreb within the Yugoslav constituent republic of Croatia. Isaac Stern provided the violin solos.\n\nThe film follows the plot of the stage play very closely, retaining nearly all of the play's dialogue while adding a new scene showing Perchik being arrested, although it omits the songs Now I Have Everything and The Rumor (I Just Heard). It takes place in the Jewish village of Anatevka, within the Pale of Settlement in westernmost Tsarist Russia in 1905 and centers on the character of Tevye, a poor milkman, and his daughters' marriages. As Tevye says in the introductory narration, the Jews have relied upon their traditions to maintain the stability of their way of life for centuries; but as times change, that stability is threatened on the small scale by Tevye's daughters' wishes to marry men not chosen in the traditional way by the matchmaker, and on the large scale by pogroms and revolution in Russia. Lyrical Portions of Tevye's Dream (Tailor Motel Kemzoil), were omitted to avoid repetition or anything that was considered obvious.

It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films.\n\nThe screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson takes its characters and combines the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only collection: the title story and \"Risico\". In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\n\nAfter the over-the-top, science fiction-focused Moonraker, the producers wanted a conscious return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a more gritty, realistic approach, and an unusually strong narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy, Spain and England, with underwater footage being shot in The Bahamas.\n\nFor Your Eyes Only was released on 24 June 1981 to a mixed critical reception; the film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the last Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the studio merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film's release.","studio":"EON Productions","genre":["Thriller","Action","Action\/Adventure","Spy","Glamorized Spy Film"],"director":["John Glen"],"role":["Roger Moore","Julian Glover","Cassandra Harris","Lynn-Holly Johnson","Carole Bouquet","Chaim Topol","Michael Gothard","Jill Bennett","James Villiers","Desmond Llewelyn","Lois Maxwell","John Wyman","Janet Brown","Paul Angelis","Geoffrey Keen","John Moreno","Sheena Easton","Charles Dance","Jack Hedley","Toby Robins","Walter Gotell"],"media":{"bitrate":1739,"aspect_ratio":2.35,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":480,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1668982720}},"3065":{"key":3065,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_3065.jpeg","title":"Four Lions","duration":6080208,"view_count":0,"tagline":"We are 4 Lions.","rating":7.0999999046326,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2010,"release_date":"2010-01-23","addedAt":1378773518,"content_rating":"R","summary":"Four Lions (2010) is a British dark comedy film.

The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first film in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an arms syndicate from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon against London in order to cause a global financial meltdown.\n\nGoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.\n\nThe film accumulated a worldwide gross of US$350.7 million, considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation into account. Some critics viewed the film as a modernisation of the series, and felt Brosnan was a definite improvement over his predecessor. The film also received award nominations for \"Best Achievement in Special Effects\" and \"Best Sound\" from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\n\nThe name \"GoldenEye\" pays homage to James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. While working for British Naval Intelligence as a lieutenant commander, Ian Fleming liaised with the American OSS to monitor developments in Spain after the Spanish Civil War in an operation codenamed Operation Golden Eye.

Released in 1964, it is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fr\u00f6be as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as famous Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.\n\nThe film's plot has Bond investigating gold smuggling by gold magnate Auric Goldfinger and eventually uncovering Goldfinger's plans to attack the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. Goldfinger was the first Bond blockbuster, with a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. Principal photography occurred from January to in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the American states of Kentucky and Florida.\n\nThe release of the film led to a number of promotional licensed tie-in items, including a toy car from Corgi Toys which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. The promotion also included an image of gold-painted Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson on the cover of Life.\n\nMany of the elements introduced in the film appeared in many of the later James Bond films, such as the extensive use of technology and \"gadgets\" by Bond and an extensive pre-credits sequence that was not a major part of the main storyline. Goldfinger was the first Bond film to win an Academy Award and opened to largely favourable critical reception. The film was a financial success, recouping its budget in just two weeks and is hailed as the series' quintessential episode, still being acclaimed as one of the best films in the entire Bond canon.","studio":"EON Productions","genre":["Thriller","Action","Action\/Adventure","Glamorized Spy Film","Crime Fiction"],"director":["Guy Hamilton"],"role":["Sean Connery","Harold Sakata","Gert Fr\u00f6be","Honor Blackman","Margaret Nolan","Shirley Eaton","Nadja Regin","Tania Mallet","Bill Nagy","Cec Linder","Bernard Lee","Lois Maxwell","Austin Willis","Les Tremayne","Garry Marshall","Bob Simmons","Desmond Llewelyn","Burt Kwouk"],"media":{"bitrate":1900,"aspect_ratio":1.66,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":576,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1567578885}},"158":{"key":158,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_158.jpeg","title":"Gone Baby Gone","duration":6835460,"view_count":0,"tagline":"Everyone Wants The Truth...

It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family associates Henry Hill and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980.\n\nScorsese initially named the film Wise Guy, but postponed it, and later Pileggi and himself changed the name to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals where Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, and put them into a revised script the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\nGoodfellas performed well at the box office, grossing $46.8 million domestically, well above its $25 million budget. It also received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won one for Pesci in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role category. Scorsese's film won five awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, including Best Film, and Best Director. The film was named Best Film of the year by various film critics groups. Goodfellas is often considered one of the greatest films ever, both in the crime genre and in general, and was deemed \"culturally significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Scorsese followed this film up with two more films about organized crime: 1995's Casino and 2006's The Departed.\n\nThe film ranks twelfth in the list of films that most frequently use the word \"fuck\".","studio":"Warner Bros.","genre":["Thriller","Biographical film","Film adaptation","Drama","Gangster Film","Crime Drama","Crime Fiction"],"director":["Martin Scorsese"],"role":["Frank Vincent","Frank Sivero","Debi Mazar","Mike Starr","Catherine Scorsese","Samuel L.

The three films together will act as prequels to Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy.\n\nThe story is set in Middle-earth sixty years before The Lord of the Rings, and portions of the film are adapted from the appendices to Tolkien's The Return of the King novel. An Unexpected Journey tells the tale of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) on a quest across Middle-earth to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon. The film premiered in New Zealand on 28 November 2012 and was released internationally from 12 December 2012.\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Peter Jackson, his longtime collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (who also co-wrote The Lord of the Rings), and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct the film before leaving the project in 2010.\n\nThe Hobbit has grossed over $1 billion at the box office, surpassing both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers nominally.

(Serkis also played Lumpy, the galley chef on the SS Venture.) Set in 1932-1933 New York City and the nightmarish Skull Island, the film tells the story of an overly ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to mysterious Skull Island, where they encounter King Kong, a legendary giant gorilla. Captured, he is displayed in New York City, with tragic results.\n\nThe film's budget climbed from an initial US$150 million to a record-breaking $207 million. The film was released on December 14, 2005, and made an opening of $50.1 million. While the film performed lower than expectations, King Kong made domestic and worldwide grosses that eventually added up to $550 million, becoming the fourth-highest grossing film in Universal Pictures history. It also generated $100 million in DVD sales upon its home video release. The film garnered generally positive reviews from film critics and appeared on several \"top ten\" lists for 2005, though some reviewers criticized it for its 3 hour, 7 minute running time.

Colin Firth plays King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new King relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.\n\nSeidler read about George VI's life after overcoming a stuttering condition he endured during his youth. He started writing about the relationship between the monarch and his therapist as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. The opening scenes were filmed at Elland Road in Leeds, which stood in for the old Wembley Stadium. For indoor scenes, Lancaster House substituted for Buckingham Palace, and Ely Cathedral stood in for Westminster Abbey. The cinematography differs from other historical dramas: hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider than normal lenses were employed to recreate the King's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters: in his first consultation with Logue, George VI is captured hunched on the side of a couch at the edge of the frame.\n\nReleased in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2011, The King's Speech was a major box office and critical success. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of \u00a38 million, it earned over $400 million internationally (\u00a3250 million). It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance; his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor was the sole win at that ceremony from seven nominations. The King's Speech won seven British Academy Film Awards, including Best Picture, and Best Actor (Firth), Best Supporting Actor (Rush), and Best Supporting Actress (Helena Bonham Carter). The film also won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler).","studio":"The Weinstein Company","genre":["Biography","Historical fiction","Biographical film","History","Historical drama","Period piece","Drama"],"director":["Tom Hooper"],"role":["Helena Bonham Carter","Guy Pearce","Colin Firth","Michael Gambon","Geoffrey Rush","Timothy Spall","Jennifer Ehle","Derek Jacobi","Max Callum","Tim Downie","Mary Robinson","Filippo Delaunay","Sean Talo","Robert Portal","Richard Dixon","Paul Trussell","Adrian Scarborough","Andrew Havill","Charles Armstrong","Roger Hammond","Calum Gittins","Dominic Applewhite","Ben Wimsett","Eve Best","Anthony Andrews","Sean Talo","Freya Wilson","Ramona Marquez"],"media":{"bitrate":1644,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"mpeg4","video_resolution":480,"video_framerate":"NTSC","total_size":1460886292}},"3001":{"key":3001,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_3001.jpeg","title":"The Kingdom","duration":6585620,"view_count":0,"tagline":"Trust No One","rating":8.1000003814697,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2007,"release_date":"2007-08-22","addedAt":1365953914,"content_rating":"R","summary":"The Kingdom is a 2007 action film directed by Peter Berg and starring Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Ashraf Barhom, with Kyle Chandler, Jeremy Piven, Richard Jenkins and Ali Suliman.\n\nThe film is fictional, but inspired by bombings at the Riyadh compound on May 12, 2003 and the Khobar housing complex on June 26, 1996, in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Slater is a fictional character even within the film, the hero of the Jack Slater series of action films. Austin O'Brien co-stars as a boy who is magically transported into a parallel universe inhabited by Slater and the other characters in the Slater film series. Schwarzenegger also plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater, and Charles Dance plays an assassin who escapes from the Slater world into the real world.

The plot spans 17 years and is set against a backdrop of political turmoil, which in the film culminates in the June Rebellion of France.\n\nDevelopment of Les Mis\u00e9rables based on the stage musical began in the late 1980s. After the musical's 25th Anniversary concert in October 2010, producer Cameron Mackintosh announced that the film resumed development. Hooper and Nicholson were approached in March 2011 and the main characters were cast in 2011. \nPrincipal photography commenced in March 2012, and took place in various English locations, including Greenwich, London, Chatham, Winchester and Portsmouth,as well as in Gourdon, France.\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables premiered in London on December 5, 2012, and was released on December 25, 2012 in the United States, on December 26, 2012 in Australia, and on January 11, 2013 in the UK. \nThe film received divided, but generally positive reviews, with many critics praising the cast, especially Jackman and Hathaway, while most criticized Crowe's performance.

It tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Graham Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.\n\nThe film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate (effectively preventing the film from being shown, as the distributors said the film could not be shown unless it was unedited and carried the original AA (14) certificate). Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades. The film makers used such notoriety to benefit their marketing campaign, with posters stating \"So funny it was banned in Norway!\".\n\nThe film was a box-office success, grossing fourth-highest of any film in the UK in 1979 and highest of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular since then, receiving positive reviews. The film received a 96% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus \"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical\", and it was named \"greatest comedy film of all time\" by several magazines and television networks. It is the first Monty Python film to receive an R rating in the United States.","studio":"Warner Bros.

Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Superman, the film is a reboot of the Superman film series that portrays the character's origin story. The film stars Henry Cavill in the title role, with Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El. Man of Steel is planning to launch a shared fictional universe of DC Comics characters on film.\n\nDevelopment began in 2008 when Warner Bros. Pictures took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling resulted in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.\n\nMan of Steels red carpet premiere in the U.S. was attended by its principal cast members in New York City on June 10, 2013. The film was released to the general public on June 14, 2013, in conventional, 3D and IMAX theaters. The film became a box office success, grossing more than $662 million worldwide, despite a mixed response from critics. Some critics highlighted the film's narrative, acting, visuals and reinvention of the titular character, while others were critical of the film's pacing and lack of character development.

A loose adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel of same name, the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun was the fourth and final film in the series directed by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set in the face of the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme in the script\u2014Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular martial arts film craze, with several kung-fu scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being shot in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau.\n\nThe film saw mixed reviews, with Christopher Lee's performance as Scaramanga, intended to be a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond, being praised; but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly the comedic approach, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon. Although the film was profitable, it is the fourth lowest-grossing Bond film in the series. It was also the final film to be co-produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in Danjaq, LLC, the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.","studio":"EON Productions","genre":["Thriller","Action","Adventure","Action Thrillers","Glamorized Spy Film"],"director":["Guy Hamilton"],"role":["Herv\u00e9 Villechaize","Roger Moore","Christopher Lee","Britt Ekland","Maud Adams","Carmen du Sautoy","Lois Maxwell","Bernard Lee","Clifton James","Marc Lawrence","Richard Loo","Soon-Tek Oh","James Cossins","Marne Maitland","Desmond Llewelyn","Yao Lin Chen"],"media":{"bitrate":1825,"aspect_ratio":1.85,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":480,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1713283603}},"2989":{"key":2989,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_2989.jpeg","title":"The Man with the Iron Fists","duration":5711044,"view_count":0,"tagline":"Seven clans, a fortune in gold.

Directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Dustin Lance Black, the film stars Sean Penn as Milk and Josh Brolin as Dan White, a city supervisor who assassinated Milk. The film was released to much acclaim, earned numerous accolades from film critics and guilds. Ultimately, it received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, winning two for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Penn and Best Original Screenplay for Black.\n\nAttempts to put Milk's life to film followed a 1984 documentary of his life and the aftermath of his assassination, titled The Times of Harvey Milk, which was loosely based upon Randy Shilts's biography, The Mayor of Castro Street. (The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for 1984, and was awarded Special Jury Prize at the first Sundance Film Festival, among other awards.) Various scripts were considered in the early 1990s, but projects fell through for different reasons, until 2007. Much of Milk was filmed on Castro Street and other locations in San Francisco, including Milk's former storefront, Castro Camera.\n\nMilk begins on Harvey Milk's 40th birthday (in 1970), when he was living in New York City and had not yet settled in San Francisco. It chronicles his foray into city politics, and the various battles he waged in the Castro neighborhood as well as throughout the city, and political campaigns to limit the rights of gay people in 1977 and 1978 run by Anita Bryant and John Briggs. His romantic and political relationships are also addressed, as is his tenuous affiliation with troubled Supervisor Dan White; the film ends with White's double homicide of Milk and Mayor George Moscone. The film's release was tied to the 2008 California voter referendum on gay marriage, Proposition 8, when it made its premiere at the Castro Theatre two weeks before election day.","studio":"Focus Features","genre":["Biography","Indie","Biographical film","History","Political drama","Period piece","Drama","Tragedy","LGBT"],"director":["Gus Van Sant"],"role":["Sean Penn","James Franco","Emile Hirsch","Victor Garber","Josh Brolin","Lucas Grabeel","Diego Luna","Denis O'Hare","Alison Pill","Jeff Koons","Joseph Cross","Kelvin Yu","Stephen Spinella","Lynn McRee","Brandon Boyce","Carol Ruth Silver","Howard Rosenman","Dave Franco"],"media":{"bitrate":7299,"aspect_ratio":1.85,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"dca","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":720,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":7024523409}},"247":{"key":247,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_247.jpeg","title":"Million Dollar Baby","duration":7955327,"view_count":0,"tagline":"Beyond his silence, there is a past.

Dick. It is set primarily in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia in the year 2054, where \"PreCrime\", a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge provided by three psychics called \"precogs\". The cast includes Tom Cruise as PreCrime captain John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as the senior precog Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton's superior Lamar Burgess. The film is a combination of whodunit, thriller and science fiction.Buckland. Pgs.\u00a0193\u20135.\n\nSpielberg has characterized the story as \"fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot\". The film's central theme is the question of free will versus determinism. It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance. Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry, the role of media in a future state where electronic advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of broken families.\n\nThe film was first optioned in 1992 as a sequel to another Dick adaptation, Total Recall, and started its development in 1997, after a script by Jon Cohen reached Spielberg and Cruise. Production suffered many delays due to Cruise's Mission: Impossible\u00a0II and Spielberg's A.I. running over schedule, eventually starting in March 2001. During pre-production, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists in an attempt to present a more plausible future world than that seen in other science fiction films, and some of the technology designs in the film have proven prescient. Minority Report has a unique visual style. It uses high contrast to create dark colors and shadows, much like a film noir picture. The film's overlit shots feature desaturated colors which were achieved by bleach-bypassing the film's negative in post-production.\n\nMinority Report was one of the best reviewed films of 2002. It received praise for its writing, visuals and themes, but earned some criticism for its ending which was considered inconsistent with the tone of the rest of the movie. The film was nominated for and won several awards. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing, and eleven Saturn Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Saturn Award for Best Music, winning Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing and Best Supporting Actress. The film was a commercial success, earning over $358 million worldwide against an overall budget of $142 million (including advertising). Over four million DVDs were sold in its first few months of home release.","studio":"20th Century Fox","genre":["Thriller","Dystopia","Chase Movie","Crime Fiction","Future noir","Action","Mystery","Film noir","Action\/Adventure","Film adaptation","Science Fiction","Drama"],"director":["Steven Spielberg"],"role":["Neal McDonough","Peter Stormare","Kathryn Morris","Steve Harris","Tim Blake Nelson","Lois Smith","Anna Maria Horsford","Jessica Capshaw","Patrick Kilpatrick","Daniel London","Allie Raye","Paul Wesley","Spencer Treat Clark","Tyler Patrick Jones","Tom Cruise","Max von Sydow","Colin Farrell","Samantha Morton"],"media":{"bitrate":6047,"aspect_ratio":2.35,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"dca","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":1080,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":6587727626}},"902":{"key":902,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_902.jpeg","title":"Miracle on 34th Street","duration":5784415,"view_count":0,"tagline":"Capture the spirit of Christmas with this timeless classic!","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":1947,"release_date":"1947-05-02","addedAt":1356280352,"content_rating":"G","summary":"Kris Kringle, seemingly the embodiment of Santa Claus, is asked to portray the jolly old fellow at Macy's following his performance in the Thanksgiving Day parade.

Categorized as a psychological thriller, the surrealist film was highly acclaimed by many critics and earned Lynch the Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne (Best Director Award) at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Director. Mulholland Drive launched the careers of Watts and Harring and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller. The film is widely regarded as one of Lynch's finest works, alongside Eraserhead (1977) and Blue Velvet (1986), and it was chosen by many critics as representative of a significant perspective of the 2000s.\n\nOriginally conceived as a television pilot, a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's version, however, television executives decided to reject it; Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic style, has left the general meaning of the movie's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics and cast members to speculate on what transpires.\n\nThe film tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms, newly arrived in Los Angeles, California, who meets and befriends an amnesiac who is hiding in an apartment that belongs to Elms's aunt. The story includes several other seemingly unrelated vignettes that eventually connect in various ways, as well as some surreal scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative.\n\nA. O.

Directed by Chris Weitz, the film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively. Melissa Rosenberg, who handed in a draft of the film script during the opening weekend of Twilight, returned as screenwriter for New Moon as well.\n\nFilming began in Vancouver in late March 2009, and in Montepulciano, Italy in late May 2009. The film was released on November 20, 2009 in most countries, and set domestic box office records as the biggest midnight screening, grossing $26.3 million, which was superseded by its sequel, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. This led to the highest single day, domestic gross on an opening day, with $72.7 million, until it was beaten in 2011 by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2, which made $91.1 million, by nearly $20 million. Furthermore, New Moon opened with the third highest domestic opening weekend since 2002 grossing a total of $142,839,137. The film also became the highest grossing film released by Summit Entertainment, and was the widest independent release, playing in over 4,100 theaters in its theatrical run, until it was surpassed by The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.\n\nNew Moon was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 20, 2010 through midnight release parties.

The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is at war with the Kaijus, colossal monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers: gigantic humanoid mecha, each controlled by two pilots whose minds are joined by a neural bridge. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaijus.\n\nDel Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an \"incredibly airy and light feel\", in contrast to the \"super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie\". The director focused on \"big, beautiful, sophisticated visuals\" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but has stated his \"real hope\" is to introduce the kaiju and mecha genres to a generation of children. While the film draws heavily on these genres, it avoids direct references to previous works. Del Toro intended to create something original but \"madly in love\" with its influences, instilled with \"epic beauty\" and \"operatic grandeur\". The end credits dedicate the film to Ray Harryhausen and Ishir\u014d Honda, who helped to establish the giant monster genre with films such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla respectively.\n\nThe film is produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. and was released on July 12, 2013 including releases in 3-D and IMAX 3D. It was released to generally positive reviews; the visual effects and action sequences were highly praised. The film received average box office returns in the United States, but was highly successful in other territories, earning more than $407 million worldwide.","studio":"Legendary Pictures","genre":["Science Fiction","Action film","Horror"],"director":["Guillermo del Toro"],"role":["Mark Baldesarra","Larry Joe Campbell","Rinko Kikuchi","Charlie Hunnam","Jake Goodman","Robert Kazinsky","Idris Elba","Ron Perlman","Max Martini","Kurrgan","Clifton Collins, Jr.","Emerson Wong","Charlie Day","Milton Barnes","Burn Gorman","Heather Doerksen","Diego Klattenhoff","Brad William Henke"],"media":{"bitrate":15144,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"dca","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":1080,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":14912384604}},"3049":{"key":3049,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_3049.jpeg","title":"Pain & Gain","duration":7776777,"view_count":4,"tagline":"Their American Dream Is Bigger Than Yours","rating":6.1999998092651,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2013,"release_date":"2013-04-26","addedAt":1377392841,"content_rating":false,"summary":"Pain & Gain is a 2013 American crime-comedy film directed by Michael Bay and starring Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie.

It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship Prometheus as it follows a star map discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the Alien franchise. Scott and director James Cameron developed ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien. By 2003, the development of Alien vs. Predator took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the Alien films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares \"strands of Aliens DNA, so to speak\", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.\n\nPrometheus entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. Principal photography began in March 2011, with an estimated US$120\u2013130 million budget. The project was shot using 3D cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards. Prometheus was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in North America. It grossed over $403 million worldwide. Reviews praised both the film's visual aesthetic design and the acting, most notably Fassbender's performance as the android David. However, the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable.","studio":"20th Century Fox","genre":["Drama","Adventure film","Horror","Thriller","Mystery","Action film","Science Fiction"],"director":["Ridley Scott"],"role":["Wambui Wa-Ngatho","Berhane Woldegabriel","Patrick Wilson","Ian MacNaughton","Daniel James","Philip McGinley","Eugene O'Hare","Branwell Donaghey","Charalambos Dendrinos","Sean Harris","Shin-Ichiro Okajima","Giannina Facio","Wannaporn Rienjang","Noomi Rapace","Harry Fowler","Stuart Saunders","Sonam Dugdak","Logan Marshall-Green","Anil Biltoo","Lucy Hutchinson","Annie Penn","Reynir Thor Eggertsson","C.C.

The film is known for its rich, eclectic dialogue, ironic mix of humor and violence, nonlinear storyline, and host of cinematic allusions and pop culture references. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture; Tarantino and Avary won for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. A major critical and commercial success, it revitalized the career of its leading man, John Travolta, who received an Academy Award nomination, as did costars Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.\n\nDirected in a highly stylized manner, Pulp Fiction connects the intersecting storylines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time criminals, and a mysterious briefcase. Considerable screen time is devoted to conversations and monologues that reveal the characters' senses of humor and perspectives on life. The film's title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue. Pulp Fiction is self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". The plot, as in many of Tarantino's other works, is presented out of chronological sequence.\n\nThe picture's self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive use of homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a prime example of postmodern film. Considered by some critics a black comedy, the film is also frequently labeled a \"neo-noir\". Critic Geoffrey O'Brien argues otherwise: \"The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir\".O'Brien (1994), p. 90. Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it \"more gangland camp than neo-noir\", and Foster Hirsch suggests that its \"trippy fantasy landscape\" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Pulp Fiction is viewed as the inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style.

The only rules during the Purge is that government officials of \"ranking 10 or higher\" must remain unharmed and usage of weaponry above \"Class 4\" (such as WMDs) is forbidden. The Purge is designed to act as a catharsis for the American people, so that they may vent all negative emotions and repressed urges however and on whoever they desire. The idea of \"The Purge\" is very similar to the Krypteia tradition every autumn of ancient Sparta.\n\nDespite mixed to negative reviews, the movie grossed $85,600,152 during its run, surpassing its $3 million budget.

It is the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. The title refers to a French dish (ratatouille) which is served in the film, and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a r\u00f4tisseur at Gusteau's restaurant; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef. The plot follows Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.\n\nDevelopment of Ratatouille began in 2001 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film. In 2005, Bird was approached to direct the film and revised the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animations used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Bird also interned at Thomas Keller's French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film. Ratatouille premiered on June 22, 2007 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California, and had its general release on June 29, 2007 in the United States. The film grossed $623.7 million at the box office and received positive reviews.

It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS)-officer Amon G\u00f6th, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. John Williams composed the score.\n\nIdeas for a film about the Schindlerjuden were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. When executive Sid Sheinberg sent a review of Schindler's Ark to Spielberg, the director was fascinated by the book. He eventually expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. However, he was unsure about his own maturity about making a film about the Holocaust. Spielberg tried to pass on the projects to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself after hearing of the various Holocaust denials.\n\nFilming took place in Poland over the course of 72 days, in Krak\u00f3w. Spielberg shot the film like a documentary, and decided not to use storyboards while shooting Schindler's List. Cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski wanted to give a timeless sense to the film. Production designer Allan Starski made the sets darker or lighter than the people in the scenes, so they would not blend. The costumes had to be distinguished from skin tones or colors being used for the sets. In composing the score to Schindler's List, Williams hired violinist Itzhak Perlman to perform the film's main theme.\n\nSchindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993 in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993 in the United States. Regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, it was a box office success and recipient of seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (seven BAFTAs, three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time (up one position from its 9th place listing on the 1998 list).","studio":"Universal Studios","genre":["Biography","Black-and-white","Biographical film","History","Period piece","Film adaptation","Drama","War film","Tragedy","Biopic [feature]"],"director":["Steven Spielberg"],"role":["Embeth Davidtz","Caroline Goodall","Ludger Pistor","Mark Ivanir","Miri Fabian","Ezra Dagan","Aldona Grochal","Albert Misak","Beata Paluch","Anna Mucha","Malgoscha Gebel","Jonathan Sagall","Beata Nowak","Adi Nitzan","Friedrich von Thun","Krzysztof Luft","Harry Nehring","Shmulik Levy","Liam Neeson","Ben Kingsley","Ralph Fiennes","Olaf Lubaszenko"],"media":{"bitrate":6707,"aspect_ratio":1.85,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"dca","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":720,"video_framerate":"PAL","total_size":9412469869}},"2624":{"key":2624,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_2624.jpeg","title":"Scrooge","duration":5191893,"view_count":0,"tagline":false,"rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":1951,"release_date":"1951-10-31","addedAt":1356540998,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"Ebeneezer Scrooge (Alastair Sim) contentedly meanders through his life as a cruel miser until one fateful Christmas Eve when he is visited by three ghosts.

It was distributed by MGM and Sony Pictures Entertainment. It features Daniel Craig in his third performance as James Bond, and Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the film's antagonist. The film was directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan.\n\nThe film centres on Bond investigating an attack on MI6; the attack is part of a plot by former MI6 operative Raoul Silva to humiliate, discredit and kill M as revenge against her for betraying him. The film sees the return of two recurring characters to the series after an absence of two films: Q, played by Ben Whishaw, and Eve Moneypenny, played by Naomie Harris. Skyfall is the last film of the series for Judi Dench, who played M, a role that she had played in the previous six films. The position is subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes' character, Gareth Mallory.\n\nMendes was approached to direct the film after the release of Quantum of Solace in 2008. Development was suspended when MGM encountered financial troubles and did not resume until December 2010; during this time, Mendes remained attached to the project as a consultant. The original screenwriter, Peter Morgan, left the project during the suspension. When production resumed, Logan, Purvis, and Wade continued writing what became the final version of the script. Filming began in November 2011 and primarily took place in the United Kingdom, with smaller portions shot in China and Turkey.\n\nSkyfall premiered in London at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 October 2012 and was released in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2012 and the United States on 9 November 2012. It was the first James Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues, although it was not filmed with IMAX cameras. The film's release coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Bond series, which began with Dr. No in 1962. Skyfall was positively received by critics and at the box office, becoming the 14th film, as well as the first Bond film, to cross the $1 billion mark worldwide. As of May 2013, it is the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film in the UK, the highest-grossing film in the Bond series, the highest-grossing film worldwide for both Sony Pictures and MGM, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2012. The film won several accolades, including two BAFTA Awards, two Academy Awards and two Grammys.","studio":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","genre":["Crime Fiction","Action film","Thriller","Spy film","Adventure film"],"director":["Sam Mendes"],"role":["Naomie Harris","Wayne Anthony Gordon","Tonia Sotiropoulou","Kenneth Hazeldine","Shane Nolan","Burt Caesar","Hannah Stokely","Angela Tran","Luke Howard","Crispin Letts","Mihai Arsene","Harry Kershaw","Chooye Bay","Khan Bonfils","Joe Cameron Brown","Michael Pink","David Gillies","Amber Elizabeth","Martin Poole","Liang Yang","Wolf Blitzer","Duncan Meadows","Greg Bennett","Enoch Frost","Dominique Anne Jones","Eric Michels","Luke Howard","Sid Man","Roger Yuan","Selva Rasalingam","Kammy Darweish","Nicholas Woodeson","Paul Venables","Huw Edwards","Duncan Casey","Jarah Mariano","Jim Conway","Helen McCrory","David Frost","Glenn Webster","Tank Dong","Stuart Mulcaster","Adebayo Bolaji","James Li","Jake Francis","Jens Hult\u00e9n","Dave Wong","Ross Waiton","Anthony O'Donnell","Neil Alexander Smith","Ben Loyd-Holmes","Mayo Oliver","Ralph Fiennes","Yennis Cheung","Oliver Johnstone","Ian Bonar","Chris Cowlin","Gordon Milne","Santi Scinelli","Kris Dillon","B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe","Neve Gachev","Peter Basham","Benjayx Murphy","Shaun Lucas","Jake Fairbrother","Alan Low","Eddie Ruben","Carol Cummings","Senem Temiz","Katherine Elizabeth McLean","Amir Boutrous","Elize du Toit","John Hodgkinson","Bill Buckhurst","Darren Lynch","Elia Lo Tauro","Daniel Adegboyega","Joss Skottowe","Dion Williams","Ola Rapace","Kurt Egyiawan","Michael G.

Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. the Green Goblin), Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary-Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.\n\nAfter being stuck in development hell for nearly 25 years, the film was licensed for a worldwide release by Sony Pictures Entertainment in 1999 after it acquired options from MGM on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from this multi-script acquisition (a screenplay credited to James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen and \"Joseph Goldman\" (the pen name of Menahem Golan) and a later treatment credited solely to Cameron), Sony hired David Koepp to create a working screenplay from this \"Cameron material\". Directors Roland Emmerich, Tim Burton, Chris Columbus, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during preproduction and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production.\n\nFilming took place in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City from 1 January to 30 June 2001. Spider-Man was released on May 3, 2002, and became a critical and financial success. With $821.7 million worldwide, it was 2002's third-highest-grossing film and is the 33rd highest-grossing film of all time. Reviews were very positive with critics praising the film in several aspects. Spider-Man was, for its time, the only film to reach $100 million dollars in its first weekend, the largest opening weekend gross of all time, and the most successful film based on a comic book. The film's success marked the beginning of a Spider-Man film series, with sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007) released, directed by Raimi with Maguire, Dunst and Franco reprising their roles. The film series was rebooted with The Amazing Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb and released on July 3, 2012.","studio":"Marvel Studios","genre":["Fantasy","Coming of age","Action","Action\/Adventure","Adventure","Superhero movie"],"director":["Sam Raimi"],"role":["Bruce Campbell","Rosemary Harris","Cliff Robertson","J.

It is the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, as the first of a three-part prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the first film in the saga in terms of story chronology. The film was also Lucas' first production as a film director after a 22-year hiatus following the original Star Wars film, and only his fourth overall.\n\nThe film follows the Jedi Master tehpwnerer and his apprentice kyle, who escort and protect Queen Amidala in traveling from the planet Naboo to the planet Coruscant in the hope of finding a peaceful end to a large-scale interplanetary trade dispute. It also features a young Anakin Skywalker before he became a Jedi, introduced as a young slave boy who seems to be unusually strong with nascent powers of The Force, and must contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\n\nLucas began production of this film after he had concluded that the science of film special effects had advanced to the level of what he wanted for his fourth film in the saga. Its filming took place during 1997 (started on June 26, 1997) at various locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert. Its special effects included extensive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), with some of its characters and its settings being completely computerized and not existing at all in the real world.\n\nThe film premiered in theaters on May 19, 1999, sixteen years after the 1983 premiere of the previous Star Wars film, Return of the Jedi. The film's premiere was accompanied by considerable hype, extensive media coverage and great anticipation, due to the large cultural following its predecessors had created.

Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane, while battling the villainous Lex Luthor.\n\nThis version was conceived in 1973 by Ilya Salkind. Several directors, most notably Guy Hamilton, and screenwriters (Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman and Robert Benton) were associated with the project before Donner was hired to direct. Donner brought Tom Mankiewicz in to rewrite the script, feeling it was too campy. Mankiewicz was credited as creative consultant. It was decided to film both Superman and Superman II simultaneously.\n\nPrincipal photography started in March 1977 and ended in October 1978. Tensions rose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming Superman II and finish the first film. Donner had already shot 75% of the planned sequel, eventually giving birth to Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut. Superman was released with critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers noted parallels between the film's depiction of Superman and Jesus and particularly praised Reeve's performance.

For this reason, Superman II is surrounded with controversy since original director Richard Donner had completed, by his estimation, roughly 75% of the movie in 1977 before being taken off the project. Many of the scenes were shot by second director Richard Lester, who had been an uncredited producer on the first film. However, in order to receive full director's credit, Lester had to shoot up to 51% of the film which included refilming several sequences originally filmed by Donner. According to statements made by Donner, roughly 25% of the theatrical cut of Superman II contains footage he shot, including all of Gene Hackman's scenes.\n\nSuperman II was released in Europe and Australia on December 4, 1980, and in other countries throughout 1981. Selected premiere engagements of Superman II were presented in Megasound, a high-impact surround sound system similar to Sensurround. \n\nIn 2006, a re-cut of the film was released titled Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut. The new version restores as much of Donner's original conception as possible, with approximately 83% of his footage included. Some of Lester's theatrical footage was retained to fill-in gaps in the story line that Donner had not been able to film before his firing.","studio":"Warner Bros.

It stars Brandon Routh as Superman, as well as Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, James Marsden, Frank Langella, and Parker Posey, and tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme that will destroy the world, starting with the United States.\n\nAfter a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Superman on the screen, Warner Bros. hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop Superman Returns in July 2004.

It is the 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. It is loosely based on the German fairy tale \"Rapunzel\" in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm. The film features the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy. The film tells the story of a lost princess with long magical hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. Against her mother's wishes, she enlists the aid of a bandit thief to take her out into the world which she has never seen.\n\nThe film was originally titled and marketed as Rapunzel until it was changed to Tangled shortly before its release. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million which, if accurate (and adjusted for inflation), would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the second most expensive film of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation together, while utilizing non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled.\n\nTangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. Distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, The film earned in worldwide box office revenue, of which was earned in the United States and Canada; it was well received by critics and audiences alike. Tangled was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2011; an animated short sequel, Tangled Ever After, was released in 2012.","studio":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","genre":["Fantasy","Comedy","Computer Animation","Romance Film","Musical","Revisionist Fairy Tale","Animation","Family Film"],"director":["Byron Howard","Nathan Greno"],"role":["Mandy Moore","Zachary Levi","Donna Murphy","Ron Perlman","M.

A sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Tron, it is directed by Joseph Kosinski, produced by Tron director Steven Lisberger, and written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, based on a story by Horowitz, Kitsis, Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal. The cast includes Tron veterans Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner, who reprised their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley, as well as actors and actresses such as Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, Beau Garrett, Michael Sheen, and James Frain. The story follows Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund), who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called the Grid, where Sam, his father, and the algorithm Quorra (Olivia Wilde) stop the malevolent program CLU from invading the human world.\n\nInterests in creating a sequel for Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, a concerted effort to devise Tron: Legacy began in 2005, when producers hired Klugman and Sternthal as writers for the film. Kosinski was recruited for the directing role two years later. Since he was not optimistic about Walt Disney Studios' Matrix-esque approach to the film, he opted for a loan, which he used to cultivate a prototype and conceptualize the universe of Tron: Legacy. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Tron: Legacy was wholly shot in 3D, and 10 companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. \n\nDisney aggressively promoted Tron: Legacy, which was received with mixed reviews by film critics, who generally praised the special effects and soundtrack but were critical of the character development and the performance of the cast. The film grossed over $400 million during its worldwide theatrical run.","studio":"LivePlanet","genre":["Thriller","Computer Animation","Action","Adventure","Science Fiction","Sci-Fi Adventure"],"director":["Joseph Kosinski"],"role":["Jeff Bridges","Bruce Boxleitner","Garrett Hedlund","Olivia Wilde","Beau Garrett","Michael Sheen","Serinda Swan","James Frain","Yaya Da Costa","Anis Cheurfa","Elizabeth Mathis","Kis Yurij","Conrad Coates","Ron Selmour","Michael Sheen","Cillian Murphy","Bruce Boxleitner"],"media":{"bitrate":7476,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"dca","video_codec":"h264","video_resolution":720,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":7017219167}},"906":{"key":906,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_906.jpeg","title":"Trouble with the Curve","duration":6672548,"view_count":0,"tagline":false,"rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2012,"release_date":"2012-09-21","addedAt":1356280363,"content_rating":"PG-13","summary":"Slowed by age and failing eyesight, crack baseball scout Gus Lobel takes his grown daughter along as he checks out the final prospect of his career.

It is an adaptation of the V for Vendetta comic book by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Set in London in a near-future dystopian society, Natalie Portman stars as Evey, a working-class girl who must determine if her hero has become the very menace he is fighting against. Hugo Weaving plays V - a bold, charismatic freedom fighter driven to exact revenge on those who disfigured him. Stephen Rea portrays the detective leading a desperate quest to capture V before he ignites a revolution.\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. on Friday, November 4, 2005 (a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but was delayed; it opened on March 17, 2006, to positive reviews. Alan Moore, having already been disappointed with the film adaptations of two of his other graphic novels, From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, after reading the script for V for Vendetta refused to view the film and subsequently distanced himself from it.\n\nThe film had been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. Activists belonging to the group Anonymous use the same Guy Fawkes mask popularized by the film when they appear in public at numerous high-profile events, emulating one of its key scenes. These masks have been seen at Occupy movement events. Lloyd is quoted saying: \"The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny \u2013 and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"","studio":"Warner Bros.

The film was inspired by the account of Kathryn Bolkovac, a Nebraska police officer who was recruited to serve as a UN peacekeeper with DynCorp International in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1999. While there, she discovered a sex trafficking ring that serviced and was facilitated by various DynCorp employees. Bolkovac was fired and forced out of the country after attempting to report and shut down the ring. She subsequently took the story to the BBC News in England and won a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against DynCorp.\n\nKondracki wanted her debut film to be about human trafficking and came across Bolkovac's story while in college. The process of producing the film took several years, but filming eventually took place from October to December in 2009. Advertised as a fictional dramatization of the events of the late 1990s, Kondracki states that the broad facts are accurate but that some of the details were omitted during the production. For example, she chose not to show the three-week \"breaking in\" period the trafficking victims are subjected to.\n\nThe Whistleblower premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival[http:\/\/www.ropeofsilicon.com\/article\/the-complete-2010-toronto-international-film-festival-line-up \"The Complete 2010 Toronto International Film Festival Line-up\"].

The movie drew mixed responses; a number of the actors and actresses received praise for their performances, but the intense violence depicted in several of the scenes became a subject of debate among reviewers, with some criticizing it as exploitive. Kondracki and Weisz responded that what had happened in Bosnia had actually been toned down in the film portrayal. The Whistleblower received several awards and nominations, including for the 2012 Genie Awards.","studio":"Barry Films","genre":["Thriller","Biographical film","Drama"],"director":["Larysa Kondracki"],"role":["Rachel Weisz","Liam Cunningham","Rayisa Kondracki","Paula Schramm","David Hewlett","David Strathairn","Nikolaj Lie Kaas","Roxana Condurache","Jeanette Hain","Vanessa Redgrave","Monica Bellucci","Stuart Graham","Coca Bloos","Johan Philip Asb\u00e6k","Luke Treadaway","William Hope","Benedict Cumberbatch","Alexandru Potocean","Demetri Goritsas"],"media":{"bitrate":1732,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":6,"audio_codec":"ac3","video_codec":"mpeg4","video_resolution":480,"video_framerate":"24p","total_size":1459769344}},"3114":{"key":3114,"type":"movie","thumb":"plex-data\/thumb_3114.jpeg","title":"White House Down","duration":7892893,"view_count":0,"tagline":"It Will Start Like Any Other Day.","rating":6.3000001907349,"user_rating":false,"release_year":2013,"release_date":"2013-06-26","addedAt":1381617238,"content_rating":false,"summary":"White House Down is a 2013 American action film directed by Roland Emmerich about an assault on the White House by a paramilitary group and a cop rejected when trying to get a job on the Secret Service who tries to stop them.

a dubious gift from their poorer relations in Philadelphia when Grammy Award-winner Will Smith arrives as The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. His mother wants him to learn some good old-fashioned values from his successful relatives. But Will shatters the sophisticated serenity of Bel-Air with his streetwise common sense, much to the dismay of his upper-crust uncle, Philip Banks (James Avery), Aunt Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten and Daphne Maxwell Reid) and three conceited cousins, Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), Hilary (Karyn Parsons) and Ashley (Tatyana Ali) - and even the butler, Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell). As the Banks family opens their home - and their checkbook - to their needy relative, Will adapts easily to their indulgent lifestyle. Yet, he reminds everyone that the simplest pleasures of family life can't be bought at any price. Repeats can be seen on Nick at Nite, The N (Noggin's nightime program lineup), and weekday
